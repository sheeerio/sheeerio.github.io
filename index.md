# Gunbir Singh Baveja

I'm a junior at UBC studying Computer Science.

I'm broadly interested in artificial intelligent agency, with a vision to create true.\sidenote{}{for some reason, 'true' makes me think of wall-e like robots; they have their life-like charm.} agents that can learn, and interact continually. To that end, I'm currently working on addressing loss of plasticity in continual learning.

I like to overthink on topics and sometimes jot down certain thoughts [here](/requietis/).

You can check out my [academic page](https://www.students.cs.ubc.ca/~gbaveja/), and my [github](https://github.com/sheeerio).
