# Gunbir Singh Baveja

I'm a senior at UBC studying Computer Science.

I am interested in moving closer to the vision of a "[child machine](https://www-formal.stanford.edu/jmc/child.pdf)" and in the formal foundations of intelligent agency. To that end, my goal is to develop principled frameworks for continual learning that clarify the assumptions under which long-horizon intelligence becomes possible. 

Currently, I am working with Prof. [Mark Schmidt](https://cs.ubc.ca/~schmidtm) on understanding "loss of plasticity" in deep networks.

I like to overthink on topics and sometimes jot down certain thoughts [here](/requietis/).

You can check out my [academic page](https://www.students.cs.ubc.ca/~gbaveja/), and my [github](https://github.com/sheeerio).
