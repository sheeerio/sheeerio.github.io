# Hi

I am a PhD student at NYU working with Eugene Vinitsky. My research interests are in building autonomous agents that learn by interacting with the environment through the lens of sequential decision making.\sidenote{hi}{Hey there!} A focus of my research is to understand the interaction of several agents and study emergent intelligent behaviours. I am particularly interested in the settings of non-stationary environments and incomplete observationsâ€”like in multi-agent RL. I also have an interest in and find inspiration from stochastic control, probability theory and statistics.
