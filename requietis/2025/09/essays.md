# Essays

I consider this lowly part of the internet a safe haven, where I get to write whatever I want, however I want. I shall get to challenge hard ideas, defend non-germane claims, or artfully respond to bathroom hypotheticals here - for which I'm grateful. 

So, being the proponent of freedom of expression, I dedicate this blog to practicing my writing eloquence. I wish to focus on three aspects: critical thinking, fluency, and persuasiveness. By the end of the many essays I may draft here, I hope to improve my volubility and articulation. 

The topics, some trivial and others controversial, that I will argue for or against are mentioned in this [convenient document](https://www.ets.org/pdfs/gre/analytical-writing-pool.pdf).\sidenote{}{As you might have noticed, writing this blog serves as an excuse to finally work on the soporific gre prep.} The format will follow me arguing for or against a claim made in the title of the essay, although the nature of my arguments may be contingent to the essay-particular instructions mentioned in that convenient paper.

I will update this blog from time to time, mentioning the date when I do so, so that you can hold me accountable.
> Should I write the feedback for each essay as well?

Perhaps I will. And, perhaps that is the best way to do it. However, I will try to be as concise as possible, for the focus shall not be deterred from what you will ultimately find valuable.
