# Gunbir Singh Baveja

I'm an incoming third year undergraduate at UBC in Vancouver pursuing a combined major in Computer Science and Statistics.

I'm broadly interested in artificial intelligent agency, with a vision to create true agents that can plan, reason, and interact naturally. To that end, I'm currently focusing on reinforcement learning with an effort to improve adaptation and efficiency of scalable model-based algorithms.

I sometimes write [here](/requietis/). You can check out my most recent statement [here](/notes/statement.pdf).
