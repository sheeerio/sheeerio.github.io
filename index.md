# Gunbir Singh Baveja

I'm a junior at UBC in Vancouver pursuing a combined major in Computer Science.

I'm broadly interested in artificial intelligent agency, with a vision to create true agents that can plan, reason, and interact naturally. To that end, I'm currently working on proto-RL methods as alternates to backprop.

I sometimes write [here](/requietis/). You can check out my most recent statement [here](/notes/statement.pdf), and my [github](https://github.com/sheeerio).

Feel free to reach out to me at `gbaveja[at]student[dot]ubc[dot]ca`.
